INFO 498B - Final Project

##Presentation Pitch

###Core User Stories
* `DONE` As an amateur baker, I want to be able to easily retrieve recipes so that I can spend more time baking and less time picking a recipe.
* `WOULD BE NICE IF IT AUTO-UPDATED LIST` As a baker, I want to be able to search for recipes using keywords so I can quickly find a recipe to make.
* `DONE` As a baker, I want to be able to see well-formatted step-by-step instructions so that I donâ€™t have to struggle to find the next step whenever I lose my place in the recipe.
* `DONE - although an alarm sound would be nice` As a busy user, I want to be able to set an alarm informing me when my baking is complete or almost done so that I may leave the room to do other things while waiting.


###Optional User Stories
* `TODO` As an avid baker, I want to be able to store recipes that I like so I can refer to them later.
* As a user with baker friends, I want to share my favorite recipes on Facebook so that my friends can try them out.
* `SORTA? - maybe add picture as last view? ` As an amateur baker, I want to be able to see what the finished product will look like so I may know how badly I messed up.
* `DONE - in the ingredients view` As an avid baker, I want to be able to see how long each recipes take so I can choose the right recipe given the amount of time I have available.
* As a busy baker, I want to be able to alert someone else via text when baking is almost complete so they can turn off the oven if I cannot
